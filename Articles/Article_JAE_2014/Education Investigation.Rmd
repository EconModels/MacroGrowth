This is a study of the effects of education on the estimation of parameters for South African growth.

Data
----------------------------------------------------------------
The following graph shows historical data, indexed to 1973.

```{r HistoricalData}
historicalData <- SUN
```


Formal Education Only
----------------------------------------------------------------
We begin by fitting GDP to the historical capital (K) and labor (L) data, using formal labor data only.

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
