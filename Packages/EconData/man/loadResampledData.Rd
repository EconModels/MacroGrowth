\title{Loads resampled coefficients, models, or fits from files}
\usage{
loadResampledData(path = "", archive = NULL, country = NULL,
  model = NULL, factors = NULL, sep = "_", kind = c("coeffs", "models",
  "fitted"), historicalData = NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{path}{the directory containing the resampled
  coefficient files. Do not add a trailing file separator.}

  \item{archive}{a zip archive containing resampled
  coefficient files}

  \item{country}{a country or vector of countries.}

  \item{model}{a model or vector of models.}

  \item{factors}{strings of factors used in fitting the
  models.}

  \item{sep}{the separator within the file names between
  country, model, and factors}

  \item{kind}{a character string that identifies which kind
  of resampled data to load.}

  \item{historicalData}{data frame containing historical
  data, used by \code{kind="fitted"}}
}
\value{
a data frame containing resampled coefficients (if \code{kind="coeffs"}),
a list of models which contain the resample fits (if \code{kind="models"}), or
a data frame containing resampled fits to the response variable (if \code{kind="fitted"}).
}
\description{
Loads resampled coefficients, models, or fits from files
}
\details{
Supply either \code{path} or \code{archive} arguments.
Defaults are correct when only one is supplied, so long as archives are constructed with
all resample files at the root level of the zip archive.
\code{kind} can be one of
\code{"coeffs"}, to load resampled coefficients;
\code{"models"}, to load models generated by the resample fits; or
\code{"fitted"}, to load fits to resampled data.
